                    I am an undergraduate student majoring in Electrical
                    Engineering from IIT-Indore. I firmly believe in teamwork
                    and positive-outlook. I recently developed a huge interest
                    in the software development domain, and Iâ€™m confident about
                    pursuing my career in this field. I am passionately
                    exploring and learning new opportunities and tools to create
                    innovative solutions to present problems.
